Nano is my favorite text editor so far after working through 2/3 of the project.

Pro's
Easier to understand with a viewable  menu at bottom of my Linux terminal that  shows shortcut keys to specific action commands.
I feel that the functionality and visualization is most simlar to both Lunix and a GUI which makes me comfortable with little experience. 

Cons
Limited functionality with word count
Unable to point and click with mouse - must use arrow keypad

Vi

Pro's
Similar to Linux
The i and escape commands made it very easy to understand where I am in regards to my terminal 
Using the colon to initiate a command is simple and user-friendly for knowing you are about to execute an action on the open file.

Cons
Unable to identify a keypad combination for counting words - had to count Kuno and Vishta by scrolling
Unable to point and click with mouse - must use arrow keypad

Emacs

I didn't like emacs at all and stopped trying to work through assignment after 15 minutes moving on to Nano.
